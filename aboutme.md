My name is Aiqi Cui ("EYE-chee TSOO-i") and my friends usually call me Chelsea. 


Here's some random things about me :


- I was born and raised in a beautiful city known for springs - [Jinan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan).
- Me and my friends are recently doing an career service platform startup which will be released on **Mid October** and I'm super excited about it.
- I love guitar and hope to become a fingerstyle guitar player one day lol. My favorite song is Sungha Jung's Flaming. 
- I love my family very much.
- I enjoy wandering randomly in the city with my friends to explore the unkown blocks.
- About 2/3 of my ins pictures are food :D
